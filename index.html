        This document represents the consensus of the group on the scope and
        features of the Vibration API. It should be noted that the group is
        aware of more advanced use cases that cannot be realized using this
        simpler first version. The intent is to address them in a future
        revision.

      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        The API is specifically designed to address use cases that require
        simple tactile feedback only. Use cases requiring more fine-grained
        control are out of scope for this specification. This API is not meant
        to be used as a generic notification mechanism. Such use cases may be
        handled using the <cite>Notifications API</cite> [[NOTIFICATIONS]]
        specification. In addition, determining whether vibration is enabled is
        out of scope for this specification.

    <section id='conformance'>
      <p>
        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
        product: the <dfn id="ua">user agent</dfn> that implements the
        interfaces that it contains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
        this specification must implement them in a manner consistent with the
        ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL-1]],
        as this specification uses that specification and terminology.

      </p>
      <p>
        The rules for <dfn>processing vibration patterns</dfn> are as given in

          <code>visible</code>, then return false and terminate these steps.
          <div class="note">
            A trusted (also known as privileged) application that integrates
            closely with the operating system's functionality may vibrate the
            device even if such an application is not visible at all, and thus
            may ignore the previous step.

        To <dfn>validate and normalize</dfn> a <a>vibration pattern</a> given

      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>If <var>pattern</var> is a list, proceed to the next step.
        Otherwise run the following substeps:
          <ol>
            <li>Let <var>list</var> be an initially empty list, and add
            <var>pattern</var> to <var>list</var>.

        length of <var>pattern</var>.
          <div class='note'>
            If the length of a pattern is greater than max length an
            implementation of this API could consider breaking the request
            effectively into multiple shorter requests internally to achieve
            the same effect, rather than ignoring what follows the max length.
            There are cases, however, where it is appropriate to ignore the
            pattern exceeding the max length. An example is if the length is so
            long that it would effectively create a denial of service attack on
            the user. A web application might also make multiple requests if it
            is known to the application that the length is too long for some
            implementations and a possible gap in between patterns is
            acceptable.

        <li>If the length of <var>pattern</var> is greater than <var>max

            vibrate the device, or an implementation might cap the total amount

        Security and privacy considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        Vibration API is not a source of data on its own and as such is not
        producing any data possible to consume on the Web. However, it is known
        that it can serve as a source of events for other APIs. In particular,
        it is known that certain sensors such as accelerometers or gyroscopes
        are prone to tiny imperfections during their manufacturing. As such,
        they provide a fingerprinting surface that can be exploited utilizing
        the vibration stimuli generated via the Vibration API. In this sense,
        Vibration API provides an indirect privacy risk, in conjunction with
        other mechanisms. This can create possibly unexpected privacy risks,
        including cross-device tracking and communication. Additionally, a
        device that is vibrating might be visible to external observers and
        enable physical identification, and possibly tracking of the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        For these reasons, the user agent SHOULD inform the user when the API
        is being used and provide a mechanism to disable the API (effectively
        no-op), on a per-origin basis or globally.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class='informative'>
      <h2>
        Examples
      </h2>
      <p>
        In the following example the device will vibrate for 1000 milliseconds
        (ms):
      </p>
      <pre class='example highlight'>
        // vibrate for 1000 ms
        navigator.vibrate(1000);
        
        // or alternatively
        navigator.vibrate([1000]);
      </pre>
      <p>
        In the following example the pattern will cause the device to vibrate
        for 50 ms, be still for 100 ms, and then vibrate for 150 ms:
      </p>
      <pre class='example highlight'>
        navigator.vibrate([50, 100, 150]);
      </pre>
      <p>
        The following example cancels any existing vibrations:
      </p>
      <pre class='example highlight'>
          // cancel any existing vibrations
          navigator.vibrate(0);
          
          // or alternatively
          navigator.vibrate([]);
        </pre>
